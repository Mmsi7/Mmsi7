The purpose of this blog post is for me to review The Capitol building of Virtual Colonial Williamsburg in terms of visuals, content, and usability. Virtual Colonial Williamsburg is an interactive "map" of the Capitol building. This DH project's purpose is to inform and show people what it would be like visiting the Capitol building in real life. This is especially useful right now since we are currently in a pandemic. 

I first want to start off my saying that the visuals of virtual Colonial Williamsburg's are AMAZING. It is honestly like I am there in real life, but instead it is the same experience **virtually.* The camera work is amazing as well, which is important since the point of this DH project is for people to feel as if they are there. I really enjoyed how you can literally "walk through" each different floor of the Capitol and see amazing photography of each room and area along the way. Also, when you hover over a section of the building and press the section, the map takes you right there. All of these visuals make this project extremely eye-catching to the viewers. 

Next, I will discuss the content of virtual Colonial Williamsburg. At most of the different rooms and areas in which you can explore in this project, there is at least one video attached to go with whichever part you are viewing. For example, if you were to click on "Capitol: House of Burgesses, Slavery & Law" a video pops up discussing exactly what the title of the video states. This is **extremely** useful because not only are you seeing the area virtually, you can also learn a lot of information about each area! I found this project very informative content wise and learned SO much about Colonial Williamsburg, specifically the Capitol building through this virtual experience.

Last, I will discuss the DH project I chose to review, virtual Colonial Williamsburg- the Capitol building, usability wise. Overall, I believe that this project is pretty straight forward to navigate and is very user friendly. However, there is one aspect of it I would alter in order to make it even better. At the very bottom of the left hand corner there is a button that says, "panorama list." If I were making this project, I would place the button at the top, to make it more visible, since this was what I mainly used to navigate this project with. I think this project reaches a wide array of viewers from children learning about colonial williamsburg to grandparents who want to learn the history behind it. 

In conclusion I believe that Virtual Colonial Williamsburg (Capitol Building) was an extremely well done Digital Humanities project. This project's visuals, content, and usability are all outstanding. I highly recommend that everyone takes the time to enjoy this project themselves:).
