title: TEI BLOG

For the **purpose** of this blog post I will be describing my experience with TEI. TEI is a new term for me and so the first thing that I decided to do prior to this project, was look up what exactly “TEI” stands for. When I searched this term, the first thing that popped up onto google was from Wikipedia and states, “The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is a text-centric community of practice in the academic field of digital humanities, operating continuously since the 1980s.”  


In order to complete this assignment we were required to start the process of creating a digital edition of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-paper.” The first step was to read “The Yellow Wall-paper.” Below is a tweet that I wrote for class describing how I felt while reading this piece of literature.

 After reading “The Yellow Wall-paper,” it was time to start completing the Google Doc exercise. The first step of this exercise was to go over the exact passage of “The Yellow Wall-paper” that Professor Stover assigned us in order to make sure it matched the original writing. Next, we needed to add comments to the google doc in order to eventually make the TEI processes more simple. The comments that we add will explain different features of the text such as column beginnings, paragraphs, Em- dashes, italics, any misspelled words/mistakes in the text, quotes, and a few other features. I found this process very simple and was happy to complete it since it helped greatly with my TEI. Below is an image of my marked up google doc where you can see a few comments that I added throughout the document.
