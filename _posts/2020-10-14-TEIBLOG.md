title: TEI BLOG (Michaela Smith)
---

For the **purpose** of this blog post I will be describing my experience with TEI. TEI is a new term for me and so the first thing that I decided to do prior to this project, was look up what exactly “TEI” stands for. When I searched this term, the first thing that popped up onto google was from Wikipedia and states, “The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is a text-centric community of practice in the academic field of digital humanities, operating continuously since the 1980s.”  


In order to complete this assignment we were required to start the process of creating a digital edition of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-paper.” The first step was to read “The Yellow Wall-paper.” Below is a tweet that I wrote for class describing how I felt while reading this piece of literature.
