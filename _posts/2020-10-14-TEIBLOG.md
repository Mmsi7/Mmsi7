title: TEI BLOG (Michaela Smith)

For the purpose of this blog post I will be describing my experience with TEI. TEI is a new term for me and so the first thing that I decided to do prior to this project, was look up what exactly “TEI” stands for. When I searched this term, the first thing that popped up onto google was from wikipedia and states, “The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is a text-centric community of practice in the academic field of digital humanities, operating continuously since the 1980s.”
