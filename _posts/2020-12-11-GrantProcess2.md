  As stated in my previous Grant Process blog post, I will be doing my proposal on creating a Media Studies Digital Humanities website. The further along I get on my Grant Proposal, the more I want to actually complete my Media Studies Website. I know for this assignment it is just a proposal, but If I had more time in this course and had the funds to do it, I would definitely want to actually complete this project the whole way through. 

  Since my last process blog post, I have completed my grant narrative, budget, and resume. In this second blog entry about my grant process, I will briefly discuss the grant narrative, budget, and resume of my Media Studies Digital Humanities project. 

  The Grant Narrative was actually very fun, and pretty simple to write. I basically just went through my Media Studies Website and discussed exactly what I would do, If I actually completed this project. In my Grant Narrative I wrote things such as the features of my website and how it would work. Peer review on the Grant Narrative was extremely helpful as well and my partner helped me decide what things belong in the Environmental Scan, rather than the Grant Narrative. Below is one of my tweets discussing how helpful the peer review process has been.

  For the budget of my Media Studies Grant proposal, I was given a total of $1,500, but only ended up spending $1,226.95. I believe that this was a very fair budget for this grant and that I utilized my funds well. I spent my Grant Proposal money on different items such as a domain name, a graphic designer, and resources. I also added a tools section which consists of things such as headphones and a microphone, to help record my podcasts that will be on my Media Studies Website. I may add more to my budget before I submit my final proposal but below is my current budget for my Grant Proposal.

  I decided to complete a resume for my Grant Proposal because I have been lucky enough to have a fair amount of experience that will in turn help me complete the grant proposal and Media Studies Website to the best of my ability. On my resume, I added things such as my past work experiences, education, internships, college courses I took, and extracurriculars. The goal of this resume was to successfully show all of my skills and experiences. My hope is that I did an excellent job in persuading my audience that I am a great candidate to complete the Media Studies Website. 
    
  The process of writing my Grant Proposal for my Media Studies Website has been very enjoyable but slightly hard. Although some parts were challenging to me, such as learning how to write an Environmental Scan, I got through it. I worked very hard on this assignment and I am happy to put final touches on the proposal and can not wait to see how it turns out!
