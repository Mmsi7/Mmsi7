#Review Blog: Virtual Colonial Williamsburg (Capitol Building)

Project: Virtual Colonial Williamsburg (Capitol)

Project Director(s):

[Project URL] (http://virtualtours.colonialwilliamsburg.org/capitol/). 

The purpose of this blog post is for me to review The Captiol bilding of Virtual Colonial Williamsburg in terms of content and usability. Virtual Colonial Williamsburg is an interactive "map" of the Capitol building. This DH project's purpose is to inform and show people what it would be like visiting the Capitol building in real life. This is especially useful right now since we are currently in a pandemic.
