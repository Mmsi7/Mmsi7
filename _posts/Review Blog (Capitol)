The purpose of this blog post is for me to review The Capitol building of Virtual Colonial Williamsburg in terms of visuals, content, and usability. Virtual Colonial Williamsburg is an interactive "map" of the Capitol building. This DH project's purpose is to inform and show people what it would be like visiting the Capitol building in real life. This is especially useful right now since we are currently in a pandemic. 

I first want to start off my saying that the visuals of virtual Colonial Williamsburg's are AMAZING. It is honestly like I am there in real life, but instead it is the same experience **virtually.* The camera work is amazing as well, which is important since the point of this DH project is for people to feel as if they are there. I really enjoyed how you can literally "walk through" each different floor of the Capitol and see amazing photography of each room and area along the way. Also, when you hover over a section of the building and press the section, the map takes you right there. All of these visuals make this project extremely eye-catching to the viewers.
