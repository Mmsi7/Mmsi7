   The project I will be researching and completing a grant proposal for is a media studies website. I chose this project because I am a senior communication major, with a concentration in media studies. I wanted to research something that I was interested in and relate it to digital humanities which is exactly what I plan to complete in this grant proposal. 

   At first, the research process for completing my environmental scan was not an easy one. I became frustrated and kept searching for the same key words without any luck. But, with help from the NEH Website, the Christopher Newport University Library, CNU Library tutorials, and my digital humanities professor, I was able to find several credible sources. Below is a twitter post on how I felt when I began this process, and my professors helpfulness with this process.

   Through conducting my research, the major way my digital humanities project will differ from other projects and journal articles is through incorporating a podcast to discuss media studies. This incorporates digital humanities because podcasts are a form of DH. In my podcast I will include topics and include episodes such as why media studies matters, what it is, and how it relates to DH. Although there are a bunch of different journal articles, such as Tara McPherson’s article titled, “Introduction Media Studies and the Digital Humanities”, that connect DH and media studies together, my podcast will differ from this since I will relate the two by speaking out loud rather than simply words on a page. 
   
   Another way my research on media studies and digital humanities project will differ from others is that I will be making my own claims rather than tearing other claims down. In, “Thinking Digitally: A Review of N. Katherine Hayles’s How We Think: Digital Media and Contemporary Technogenesis'' the author reviews someone else's view to try to claim that it is false. I believe that instead of doing this for my project, I will come up with my own ideas and conduct research rather than bashing someone else's argument because I do not believe that it is helpful to do so. Constructive criticism is a good thing, but I believe that my project narrative will be a lot less harsh.
   
   A final way I believe that my digital humanities project that is explaining digital humanities is through the use of a website. Although there are media studies websites such as American Journalism review and digital humanities websites, I was unable to find any websites that successfully combined the two topics. I would like to incorporate the idea of creating a website in my project.

   In conclusion, although I had a challenge with research at first, writing the grant proposal as a whole has been a very fun process. I really did not know or think I would enjoy this process so much. I really enjoy the topic I chose, relating digital humanities to media studies, which may be a big reason why I enjoy the process of writing this grant.
